Welcome to the Actionforge Action source code!

Actionforge introduces Action Graphs, a faster and easier way to create and execute GitHub workflows. This new approach replaces tedious YAML file editing by hand with a user-friendly graph editor. Action Graphs are compatible with GitHub Actions. The core product consists out of 4 components:

- ‚ôæÔ∏è [VS Code Extension](https://www.github.com/actionforge/vscode-ext) - Extension to modify Action Graphs within VS Code.
- üü¢ [GitHub Action](https://www.github.com/actionforge/action) - GitHub Action that reads the Action Graph and starts the Graph Runner with it.
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [Graph Runner](https://www.github.com/actionforge/graph-runner) - The cli program that executes an Action Graph.
- üï∏Ô∏è [Graph Editor](https://www.github.com/actionforge/graph-editor) - Visual graph editor to create and build Action Graphs. These graphs will be committed to your repository.

For a full introduction check out the [Actionforge Documentation](https://www.actionforge.dev/docs).
